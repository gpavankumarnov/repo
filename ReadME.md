This file - is for quick walkthrough of the entire project.

Assume:
we are on main branch 
created a feature branch from main
now we apply our changes 
before push to remote repo
some dev has pushed some changes to remote
we need to take pull to reflect those

Remember: git pull is not possible when remote repo and your local branch has some changes need to be committed or stashed before taking pull.
